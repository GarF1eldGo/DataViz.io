### Abstract Clock Visualization
My homework [assignment](https://columbiaviz.github.io/2024s_w4995/a0.html) for the course `COMS W4995 Introduction to Data Visualization` at Columbia University.  

This is a basic clock visualization project implemented using p5.js. The innermost and thickest track represents the hour hand, the other track represents the minute hand, and the outermost sphere represents the second hand. You can try it out [here](https://garf1eldgo.github.io/DataViz.io/).
